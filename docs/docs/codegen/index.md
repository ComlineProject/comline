## Motivations

Comparing to other libraries:
as for example in contrast compared with Protobuf's gRPC codegen
implementations for some languages that might lack more concrete details,
they mildly specify Message typing, but do not provide enough Service
typing information to help IDE tools in showing or optionally enforcing
through abstraction interfaces (if the language has them)
