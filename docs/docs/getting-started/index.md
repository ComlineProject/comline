You can pick any one way to install below:
 - Platform dependent:
   - Linux:
     - Fedora: `rpm add <?> && sudo dnf install <?>`
     - Arch: `pacman install <?>`
   
   - Windows:
     - 10 and 11: download installer at `<https://some.rs/comline.msi/ ?>` 
    
   - Mac:
     - ?: ?

 - Independent tools:
   - Cargo: `cargo install comline` 
   - WinGet: `winget install <?>`


And that should be it, now you have comline available
to do anything!
