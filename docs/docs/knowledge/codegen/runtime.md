# Runtime
(If you don't know what is the Runtime about, [read the explanation](../runtime/index.md) first if you want)

For the runtime to handle your schema implementations, it has to know how
equivalent code regarding the language runtime you are using works and is.

So one way to do so without requiring compilation directly into your project
is to create a specific library with your schemas structure and information.
