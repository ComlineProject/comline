# Automatic Documentation
Since the change and versioning of APIs is incremental due to the nature of the CAS,
most components of the Schema and the Project files can be somewhat automatically documented

This automatic documentation should be human-readable, try to
make sense for any kind of reader, and it should also be a optional tool,
the project could set rules on how it wants to use it and when.
