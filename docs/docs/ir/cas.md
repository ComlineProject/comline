# Content Addressable Storage (CAS)
You probably have used a tool with CAS before just like Git, if you don't know
what a CAS is, in simple terms it is a relation of content fragmented in a way
to store each individual unique piece which you can then put
together again by doing relations, think about it like time, space and 
things that exist in the past and present

Comline's CAS is very similar to [Git's one](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects),
with a few differences that make more sense for versioning of a
project's multiple API versions and specification, commit author metadata (and more planned),
and more so on (which is planned to be explained in the future)
